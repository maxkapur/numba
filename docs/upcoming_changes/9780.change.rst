Disabling ``sys.monitoring`` support by default
-----------------------------------------------

The ``sys.monitoring`` support is disabled by default due to compatibility issues 
with native code. In Python 3.12, the implementation and documentation lacks 
clarity on native code support, which led to tools making incorrect assumptions 
about Python frames and code objects. While Python 3.13 improves this situation, 
many tools have not yet adapted to these changes. Consequently, tools may crash 
when monitoring Numba-compiled functions. To address this, Numba disables 
``sys.monitoring`` by default. Users can opt-in by setting the environment 
variable ``NUMBA_ENABLE_SYS_MONITORING``.
